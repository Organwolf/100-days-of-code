// Virtual environments

why:

resolve dependency issues
makes a project self-contained and reproducible
install packages on a host on which you do not have admin privlages

virtual environment and conda environments are diff things

what:

Python tool for **dependency management** and **project isolation**.
It is just a directory with three important components:
    site-packages
    Symlinks
    Scripts
site-packages -> a folder where third party libraries are installed
Symlinks are links to Python executables installed on your system
Scripts that ensure executed Python code uses the Python interpreter
and site packages installed inside the given virtual environment.

Don't include the venv to your teams repo.
Create your own venv inside of the proj root directory.
And then pip install -r requirements.txt

----

% source venv/bin/activate
(venv) % deactivate

(venv) % pip freeze > requirements.txt

----

how:

It comes down to PATH. In particular echo $PATH which tells the shell
what instance of Python to use and where to look for packages.
Still a bit confused on the how but that's ok.
