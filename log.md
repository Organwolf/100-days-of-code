# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about debouncing, window events, using scroll events in vanilla JS.

**Thoughts:** Had to debug my code for 10+ minutes because I had forgot the punctuation **.** while using querySelectorAll to select the elements of a certain class.

const sliderImages = document.querySelectorAll('.slide-in');

Debouncing is problably the most advanced part of this code and from what I understand it enables me to trigger a particular function a fixed amount of times instead of it triggering unnecessarily often.

### Day 1: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a TODO app in combination with localStorage so that the information persests even if you reload the page

**Thoughts**: Still working on wesbos JavaScript 30. Used event delegates in this one. I subscribe to the click event on the itemsList. Inside the function I determine which element I want to add logic to. 

**Experimented with:** SVG icons. Found an icon that fitted the theme. I actually had to fiddle around with the viewBox attribute to make the icon look ok.

viewBox="-2.35 -0.5 23 23"
